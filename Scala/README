This is the source code for ed written in Scala. It is also the source code of
my implementation of a buffer of mutable static length strings, mutable dynamic
length strings.

****************************
WHY ARE THERE SO MANY FILES?
****************************

I'm glad you asked! Welcome to the wonderful world of Scala! Because Scala is 
designed to run alongside Java, Scala translates its objects to Java Virtual 
Machine constructs. Although it's written in Scala, the object is compiled into
something recognizable by Java. These extra files are like static commands that
are recognizable to Java so Java can freely call it like any other static
command in the Java library. In Java this can typically be remedied by compressing
everything into a jar file but when I tried this in scala, it was too complex 
given my inexperience in the language.

*******************
RUNNING THE PROGRAM
*******************

To run, type either:

scala DynamicBufferCommands

or

scala StaticBufferCommands

which will run my implementation of ed with either a buffer that houses mutable
dynamic length strings or mutable static length strings, respectively.

*****************
RUNNING THE TESTS
*****************

To run the tests, type either:

python testDynamicAppendWriteMemoryTime.py

or

python testStaticAppendWriteMemoryTime.py

which will run the program 32 times, each time it reads the content of
bigbible_append_and_write.txt as input to the program. The time taken to run
the program will be reported by Python, and the amount of memory used by the
program will be reported by the respective buffers.
