Project: Studying the design and performance impacts of static length and dynamic length string implementations on an implementation of the line text editor ed<br>

Description: The aim of our project is to evaluate the design and performance impacts of static length strings and dynamic length strings in order to better understand their inclusion or exclusion in modern programming languages. To accomplish this, we chose to implement the line text editor ed in the languages C, C#, Scala, and Java. Our implementations support the commands a, i, c, d, j, l, m, n, p, t, e, and w as they are the most relevant for assessing the impacts of the different string types. Usage should largely mirror that of GNU/ed for the supported commands with the exception of support for suffixed commands.
