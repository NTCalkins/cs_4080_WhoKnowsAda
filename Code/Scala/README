This is the source code for ed written in Scala. It is also the source code of
my implementation of a buffer of mutable static length strings, mutable dynamic
length strings.

*******************
RUNNING THE PROGRAM
*******************

To run, type either:

scala DBC.jar

or

scala SBC.jar

which will run my implementation of ed with either a buffer that houses mutable
dynamic length strings or mutable static length strings, respectively.

*****************
RUNNING THE TESTS
*****************

To run the tests, type either:

python testDynamicAppendWriteMemoryTime.py

or

python testStaticAppendWriteMemoryTime.py

which will run the program 32 times, each time it reads the content of
bigbible_append_and_write.txt as input to the program. The time taken to run
the program will be reported by Python, and the amount of memory used by the
program will be reported by the respective buffers.
