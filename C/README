This is the source code for the C implementation of the text editor.
"textedit.c" contains the main driver for the program. To build the
program, compile that file.

  ex) If compiling with clang, run
        cc textedit.c

Running the program is now the simple matter of calling the resulting
executable.

To change between the static string implementation and the dynamic
string implementation, change the relevant #include statement in
LinkList.c and recompile.

Testing was accomplished with input redirection through the shell.
This is not a perfect method as the overhead introduced by the shell
is included in the time measurements. However, since the overhead is
constant and CPU time was taken instead of real time to remove any
variance caused by background processes, the resulting measurements
should be valid enough to illustrate a performance difference.

To perform the time test, compile the editor with the desired string
type and time the execution of the shell script "timethis.sh" using
the "time" function provided by your shell of choice or GNU time if
such a function is not provided. For the measurements used in the
report, the default time function provided in zsh was used.

IMPORTANT: Ensure that TimeTest.txt and the compiled executable are
located in the same directory as timethis.sh

	ex) time timethis.sh <name_of_executable>
