Quotes from the Zhuangzi...
The fish trap exists because of the fish. Once you've gotten the fish you can forget the trap. The rabbit snare exists because of the rabbit. Once you've gotten the rabbit, you can forget the snare.
Once you've gotten the meaning, you can forget the words. Where can I find a man who has forgotten words so I can talk with him?
Once upon a time, I dreamt I was a butterfly, fluttering hither and thither, to all intents and purposes a butterfly, unaware that I was myself.
Soon I awaked, and there I was, veritably myself again. Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or wheter I am now a butterfly, dreaming I am a man.
Flow with whatever may happen, and let your mind be free: Stay centered by accepting whatever you are doing. This is the ultimate.
During our dreams we do not know we are dreaming. We may even dream of interpreting a dream.
Only on waking do we know it was a dream. Only after the great awakening will we realize that this is the great dream.
I cannot tell if what the world considers happiness is happiness or not.
All I know is that when I consider the way they go about attaining it, I see them carried away headlong, grim, and obsessed, in the general onrush of the human herd, unable to stop themselves or to change their direction.
All the while they claim to be just on the point of attaining happiness.
If a man crosses a river
and an empty boat collides with his own skiff,
Even though he be bad tempered man
He will not become very angry.
But if he sees a man in the boat,
He will shout at him to steer clear.
If the shout is not heard, he will shout again, and yet again, and begin cursing.
And all because someone is in the boat.
Yet if the boat were empty,
He would not be shouting, and not angry.
If you can empty your own boat
Crossing the river of the world,
No one will oppose you,
No one will seek to harm you.
